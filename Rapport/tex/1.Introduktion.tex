This report documents the design and implementation of the control part of a vending-machine for soft-drinks. \\

The project was divided into three laboratory exercises, in which parts of the system was designed. After the finalization of all three laboratory exercises a complete vending machine control circuit was designed and implemented on a Basys2 FPGA board. The optional parts of the lab exercises is included in the elaboration of each of the exercises, which also redefines some of the mandatory functions, and update/change them as the requirements of each part changes a we move towards the finished control part. \\
