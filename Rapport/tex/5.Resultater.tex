In the end we have designed, tested and implemented following components:

\begin{itemize}
\item A clock\_manager with an addition of 3 Hz clock \texttt{clk\_3} 
\item An input\_synchronizer, to synchronize signals from the outside world to the clock, to avoid meta-stability and ensure that some of the signals only goes high for one clock cycle only. This includes buy\_out, coin1\_out, coin2\_out and coin5\_out, cola\_out, hash\_out and aqua\_out.
\item A display\_driver to convert and display price, reset, alarm, sum, cola, hash and aqua-signals on the LED-displays
\item A processing\_unit to calculate the total amount of coins inserted, comparing price with sum when buy is asserted, and either asserting alarm if sum < price, or subtracting price from sum if sum $\geq$ price. The processing unit also passes on the signals which assert product text on the led display, when a product type is chosen.
\item An overall structural component which connects all of the above mentioned components with the in- and outputs on the Basys board.
\end{itemize}
