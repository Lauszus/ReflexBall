\chapter{Abstract}

In this programming project we have written and designed all the code to the game Reflex Ball. The code has been written in C in the compiler Z8Encore! and has been implemented on a Zilog 6403 Mircrocontroller. \\ \\
We have concluded that the written code implements the desired circuit on the Microcontroller as as all the different facilities of the game has been thoroughly tested and is in compliance with the expected result. In the end we have a fully functional Reflex Ball Game with many expansions, which amongst others, include bricks (Arkanoid style), power-ups, different levels and steering-wheel game controller. So far no bugs has been found in the final version of the game.
